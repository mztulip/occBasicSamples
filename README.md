# occBasicSamples

Very basic OpenCASCADE examples that compile on Linux on the commandline with g++.
Only a .stl and .wrl is written that can be imported and viewed by a program like blender, MeshLab or view3dscene for example.
The purpose of these tiny example programs is to show the most basic usage of the Open CASCADE 3D library possible, thus flattening the learning curve for a beginner (like me).
